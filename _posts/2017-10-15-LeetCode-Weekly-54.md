# Degree of an Array
# Count Binary Substrings
Wasted time; substrings must be consecutive, can be done in `O(n)`.<br />
__Approach__ Store run-lengths into a separate array, then iterate and compare consecutive terms.
# Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets (didn't finish)
__Approach__ Tried backtracking, TLE.
# Falling Squares 
__Approach__ Only `10^3` squares, so `O(n^2)` solution works.
